<h2>. When is a project considered a success?</h2>

<p>The short of it is that a project that is completed on time and on a budget can be considered a success. However, a project can be evaluated on many criteria:
<ul>
    <li>Does it meet business requirements?</li>
    <li>Is it delivered on schedule and on a budget?</li>
    <li>Does it deliver the expected value and ROI?</li>
    <li>will it be feasible?</li>
</ul>
   <p> What defines a successful project is likely to change based on the type of project. This is why it is important to define what project success means during the initiation and planning phases of a project.
